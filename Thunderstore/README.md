# Ravemando
The UES Safe Travels is having an all-out party, and the survivors have been outfit with the greatest **RGB lighting** Petrichor V has ever seen.

## Description
Ravemando is a skin mod that adds skins to many survivors, with the primary feature being cycling colors on prominent features of each survivor.

Includes skins for:
- Commando
- Huntress
- Bandit
- Engineer
- Loader
- Captain

## Color Sets
Ravemando's default colors not suiting your fancy? All good! Ravemando has **Color Sets** to change what colors it uses.

The active Color Set can be changed by:
* Opening the *Config Editor* in r2modman / Thunderstore
* Searching for `BepInEx\config\com.jackdotpng.Ravemando.cfg`
* Selecting the result, then pressing *Edit Config*

OR

* Opening the config file manually in a text editor
    * Found in `BepInEx\config\com.jackdotpng.Ravemando.cfg`

Current color sets:
- Default
- Custom
    - Allows for 8 colors
    - Can be modified in the *Custom Color Set* config section

Color sets, along with all other config options, require Risk of Rain 2 to be run with Ravemando installed at least once before they are generated

## Config Options
Ravemando includes two config options: **Strength Multiplier** and **Cycle Time**

- **Strength Multiplier**: Controls how intense the lighting displays.
    - Defaults to ***1***
- **Cycle Time**: Controls the time (in seconds) between changing colors
    - Defaults to ***0.5 seconds***
    - If this is set too low, performance may be affected

- See above for opening / modifying config options

Config options are generated after running Risk of Rain 2 with Ravemando installed one time

Original concept inspired by `@DragonRoIlZ` and `@Kartinonos` on Twitter

Used King EnderBrine's Skin Builder for base of the mod, with my own additions added.
